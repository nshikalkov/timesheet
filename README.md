Timesheet - Time Tracker for Freelancers

This is my first PHP application. It uses Zend Framework 3 and various plugins.

I am running it on Ubuntu, Nginx, PHP7, MySql, Redis.

More notes about installation on this stack are coming soon. 
For installing on other systems I can't offer assistance and you will have to research it by yourself :)
